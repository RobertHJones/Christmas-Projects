## Handstand Page

### Robert Jones site

I decided to focus on an area for which I've been needing a website for some time - teaching handstand.

I made an approximation of a User Persona for who would be using this (they fall a little outside the categories of hubspot).

This website will primarily be used by yoga teachers, yogis and those interested in fitness/messing around with being upside down.

My User Persona broadly covers this cross section of users. With it being a large but welcoming and closely-knit community, the website needs to be functional and intuitive rather than content-heavy, as word of mouth is as important as attracting new users through the site.

Some images will be useful, both of previous workshops and of demonstrating handstand prowess to reassure users. 

The date/location of upcoming workshops should be prominent as getting users to sign up for these is the main aim of the page - social media links should also be easily accessible to gain followers.

This site will fulfil the needs of users in terms of enabling the learn of workshop availibility, and to book in/contact for private tuition.

In terms of colour I kept it simple but went for some greens which resonates with most yogis who tend to feel very connected to the earth and nature.
